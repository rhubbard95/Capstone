  <h2 class="About">A little more about me</h2>

  <section id="about me">
    <p>
      I primarily worked in customer service throughout different environments
      like fast food, the cell phone industry, and financial technology.
      Whenever Covid spread across the United States, a lot of jobs shifted to
      remote work, which I personally enjoyed. This led me to flex into the
      creative side of me and I became a content creator. After working my
      customer service position for some years, my life changed and I decided
      that it would be beneficial for me to pick up another skill set. Through
      some great people that I've met in college, I was able to find an
      opportunity to start my coding journey through Savvy Coders. I'm truly
      grateful for the opportunity and I plan on jumping back into creating
      content for myself along with seeing what cool web pages and applications
      that I can create.

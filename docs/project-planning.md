I want to build an application that helps gamers with their parry timing.

My audience would be primarily console gamers or P.C gamers as well.

pg. 1 Home page: Name, navigation to other pages. Typical home page

pg. 2 Contact information: Name, email address, online resume, navigation. This page is supposed to give the audience a way to reach out to me.

pg. 3 information page: Information about why I am coding, information about my gaming hobbies, why I chose this web application. Navigation. This page provides additional information about who I am.

pg. 4 Application page: Create user control character, create bot character, create interactive button, create color coded, translucent circles that potentially follows opponent's attack. Navigation. This page is the actual trainer which helps users with their timing for defending/parrying.

pg. 5 Survey/form: Add a survey, Create a form, Navigation. This page is for the audience to provide me feedback.

The purpose of the application is to help gamers perfect their timing the click a button in response to an opponents attack, which is common is a lot of different games.

The web application will freely navigate to every page that is available. There doesn't have to be a particular order the users have to proceed in order to use the functionality of the application.

There should be photos attached to the "assets" folder that says "Userflow.png", "Mural.png", and "Wireframe.png"

I've done a google search for a parry trainers. I wasn't able to find the type of application that I am planning on developing. When researching, I ran into different forums where multiple people talked about how to parry on specific games.

I did run into a for profit website that is a parry training platform.

SWOT Analysis: There isn't a web application that I can find that is a parry/block trainer.
When looking for this information on search engines, it defaults to reddit pages or forums about challenging
games that people need assistance with. Within these forums, people attempt to explain how to assist with particular enemies or
generic game play.
